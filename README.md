_GoCrypt_ is a CLI and GUI file encryption tool specializing in fast, convenient, and secure file encryption. With seamless integration into the Windows context menu, _GoCrypt_ allows you to encrypt and decrypt files directly from your file explorer with ease. Leveraging Go and the ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption algorithm, _GoCrypt_ boasts high performance and robust security.

### CLI Comands
`encrypt`, `enc`, `e` - encrypt provided files.

`decrypt`, `dec`, `d` - decrypt provided files.

### CLI Flags
`--output, -o` - Specify the output directory. By default _gocrypt_ will place the output file in the same directory as it was pulled from.

`--no-ui, -n` - Disable the GUI. By default _gocrypt_ will use the GUI for all user interaction.

`--layers, -l` - Define the layers of encryption. By default _gocrypt_ will use 1 layer of encryption.

*IMPORTANT* - These flags MUST be passed _before_ the file arguments. Please refer to examples below.

### CLI Examples
```
./gocrypt encrypt secret.txt
```
```
./gocrypt --no-ui encrypt secret.txt contract.pdf music.mp3
```
```
./gocrypt -n encrypt secret.txt
```
```
./gocrypt -l 5 -o "C:/output.txt" encrypt secret.txt
```

### GUI Usage

Once installed, simply right-click on any file or folder in Windows Explorer and select the GoCrypt option from the context menu. You will be prompted to enter a password to either encrypt or decrypt the selected item.

_GoCrypt_ offers a GUI for interacting with files and by default is enabled for all interactions through the CLI, context menu, or clicking directly on the desktop icon. 

When launching _GoCrypt_ without any command line parameters, the user will be presented with a window allowing them to choose files for encryption.

### Layers

By default, _GoCrypt_ encrypts all files with 1 layer of encryption. Check out [SPEC]() for more information on the encryption/decryption algorithm.
