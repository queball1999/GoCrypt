_GoCrypt_ is a CLI and GUI file encryption tool specializing in fast, convenient, and secure file encryption. With seamless integration into the Windows context menu, _GoCrypt_ allows you to encrypt and decrypt files directly from your file explorer with ease. Leveraging Go and the ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption algorithm, _GoCrypt_ boasts high performance and robust security.

### CLI Comands
`encrypt`, `enc`, `e` - encrypt provided files.

`decrypt`, `dec`, `d` - decrypt provided files.

### CLI Flags
`--output, -o` - Specify the output directory. By default _gocrypt_ will place the output file in the same directory as it was pulled from.

`--no-ui, -n` - Disable the GUI. By default _gocrypt_ will use the GUI for all user interaction.

`--layers, -l` - Define the encryption layers (200 layers max). This applies only to encryption process, as the decryption process will automatically detect the number of layers based on the file header. By default, gocrypt applies 5 layers of encryption.

*IMPORTANT* - These flags MUST be passed _before_ the file arguments. Please refer to examples below.

### Encrypting Files
_GoCrypt_ can handle both individual files and entire folders. When a file is passed as an argument, _GoCrypt_ encrypts it and outputs an .enc file. The original file can be optionally deleted after encryption.

Examples of encrypting individual files:
```
./gocrypt encrypt secret.txt
```
```
./gocrypt --no-ui encrypt secret.txt contract.pdf music.mp3
```
```
./gocrypt -n encrypt secret.txt
```
```
./gocrypt -l 5 -o "C:/output" encrypt secret.txt
```

### Encrypting Folders

When a folder is passed as an argument, _GoCrypt_ will compress the folder into a .zip file before encrypting it. This ensures that all contents of the folder are securely encrypted as a single file.
```
./gocrypt encrypt C:\path\to\folder
```
```
./gocrypt -o "C:/output" encrypt C:\path\to\folder
```

### Layers

By default, _GoCrypt_ encrypts all files with 5 layers of encryption. This only affects the encryption process as the decryption process will auto-detect layers and decrypt accordingly. Check out [SPEC](https://github.com/queball1999/GoCrypt/blob/main/SPEC.md) for more information on the encryption/decryption algorithm.

### Installation

For the latest pre-built binaries of the application, check the [Releases](https://github.com/queball1999/GoCrypt/releases) page on the repository.

### Usage

Once installed, simply right-click on any file or folder in Windows Explorer and select the GoCrypt option from the context menu. You will be prompted to enter a password to either encrypt or decrypt the selected item.

_GoCrypt_ offers a GUI for interacting with files and by default is enabled for all interactions through the CLI, context menu, or clicking directly on any .enc file. 

When launching _GoCrypt_ without any command line parameters, the user will be presented with a window allowing them to choose files for encryption.

### Compiling

The installer is generated using [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and the config file can be found in this repo.
